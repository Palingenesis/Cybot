Free Fonts Used
===============

The original Cybot print copy had a specific font that they used for the Cybot
name and also some other bits in the magazines.

I wanted to keep this look as close as possible, so found this Freeware font
called _Downlink_ distributed by [Pixel Sagas]. The font and it's license
agreement is contained in the `downlink.zip` ZIP file.
